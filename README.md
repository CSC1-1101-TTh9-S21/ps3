# Problem Set 3

### Due Friday, February 12, 2021, at 11:59pm EST

For this problem set, you will submit to Canvas **a single .zip file**. Detailed instructions for what the .zip file should contain are at the end of this problem set. Note that if you do not submit the files as specified here, there will be a major deduction in your grade for this assignment. Following directions to the letter is a crucial skill for computer programming.

## Getting started

In your `CS1` folder you create for the previous problem set, create a folder called `ps3`. You will put all of the components required for this problem set in the `ps3` folder.

## Part 1
In Part 1, you will build a financial calculator that can be used to calculate the future value of a retirement account. This is an idealized retirement account, where each year the person deposits the same amount of money on January 1, and the same interest rate is applied to the balance on December 31.

For example, suppose you deposit $100.00 per year for three years in a retirement account that earns 10% interest. On January 1 of year 1, you deposit your $100. On December 31, you will earn $10.00 interest (i.e., 10% of $100.00) giving you a balance of $110.00 after 1 year. On January of year 2 you will deposit another $100.00, giving you a balance of $210.00. Then, on December 31 of year 2, you will earn $21.00 interest (i.e., 10% of $210.00) giving you a balance of $231.00 after 2 years. On January 1 of year 3, you again deposit $100.00, giving you $331. On December 31, interest is calculated ($33.10) and added to the current balance ($331), giving you $364.10. 

Your program will be called `part1.py` and will do the following:

1. Print a message explaining that it is a retirement calculator and will be asking some questions.
2. Prompt the user to enter the size of the annual deposit in dollars.
3. Prompt the user to enter the interest rate **as a decimal** (so 10% would be 0.10).
4. Prompt the user to enter the number of years until retirement **as an integer**.
5. **Using a for loop,** calculate the  value of the retirement account when the user retires
6. Print the  value of the retirement account when the user retires.

You can check your math with this handy calculator, entering 0 for the `Current principal`.

Here is a sample run of the program:

Put `part1.py` in your `ps3` folder.

## Part 2





* for loop for calculating compound interest

* while loop for guessing a number + binary search + random numbers
